		details: 'For my final thesis, I scraped nearly 1.4 million tweets from the public twitter search page to analyze the language within. Using kmeans cluster analysis, I find themes in the tweets and seek to answer the question: "what are people really saying about #metoo?" This thesis took me all over the world â€” I spoke about it at Antenna during Dutch Design Week, the Design Indaba Conference in Cape Town, as a lightning talk at Eyeo Festival in Minneapolis, and as a d3.js meet up talk. The best video of this talk is to the right, and the files from the d3.js meet-up are located here.',

By understanding the impact of gender equality on income equality, and the striking difference in male and female indexes based on country, we can work to raise female indexes, thus lowering gender and income inequality.',
